# ShineOS
This is **ShineOS** - an online "operating system" (or just a **big joke** brought to life)

1111122 contains many applications (web applications), and there **will be more!**

Currently there are applications such as: **emulator (real), eaglecraft (minecraft), terminal (js commands, etc.) and others**

> WARNING: **DO NOT TRY TO DRINK 5-6 OR 7-8 LITERS OF OIL**
> 
Also in **ShineOS** there are 2 desktop environments - **Blue Sky (Windows-like)** and **EnviX (MacOS-like)**

Perhaps some part of the code is made by AI *(idk)*

And also perhaps **ShineOS** is somehow inspired by the North Korean RedStarOS *(i'm not sure)*
